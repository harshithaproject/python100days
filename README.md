**What is Python?**

Python is a dynamically typed, general purpose programming language that supports an object-oriented programming approach as well as a functional programming approach

Python is an interpreted and a high-level programming language.

It was created by Guido Van Rossum in 1989.

Features of Python:-

Python is simple and easy to understand

It is interpreted and platform-independent which makes debugging very easy.

Python is an open-source programming language

Python provides very big library support.Some of the popular libraries include NumPy, Tensorflow, Selenium, OpenCV etc.,

It is possible to integrate other programming languages within python.


**What is python used for?**
1. Python is used in Data Visualization to create plots and graphical representations,

2. Python helps in Data Analytics to analyze and understand raw data for insights and trends.

3. It is used in AI and Machine Learning to simulate human behavior and to learn from past data without hard coding.

4. It is used to create web applications.

5. It can be used to handle databases.

6. It is used in business and accounting to perform complex mathematical operations along with quantitative and qualitative analysis.


**New Features in Latest Python 
**1. Walrus Operator


Module - Module is like a code library which can ve used to borrow the code written by somebody else in our program. There are two types of Modules in python

1. External Modules- These modules are imported from a third party file or can be installed using a package manager like pip or conda. Since this code is written by someone else, we can install different versions of a same module with time.


2. Built-In Modules- Already buit in modules given by python to use in programming. These modules are ready to import and use and ships with the python interpreter. There is no need to install such modules.

The pip command:-
It can be used as a package manager pip to install a python module. Let's install a module called pandas using the following command

pip install pandas.


Using the import syntac to import the module in Python

import pandas as pd

pd.read_csv('words.csv')
